            Mark and Patricia were born in the Philippines. Mark's mom is one of Patricia's baptismal
            godmothers. But the two did not meet in person throughout childhood. Patricia grew up in Los
            Angeles, California. She's been living there for 16 years. On the other hand, Mark moved to
            Sydney, Australia for college and was living there for 11 years until he learned of Patricia. Mark
            decided to befriend Patricia on Facebook, and the rest is a story of friendship that developed
            into a story of love.

            About a year of talking over the phone as friends, Mark decided to finally
            visit LA and meet Patricia in person. His initial intention was to watch the Lakers play live and
            see LA for the first time. But before Mark left LA, he realized he was truly in love with the girl
            from across the Pacific Ocean. He confessed his true feelings before flying back to Sydney. A
            couple of months later, Patricia said "I love you" back to Mark. What followed was another year
            of courtship, where Mark never failed to remind Patricia every single day that they would one
            day be together again.

            In 2014, Mark took a leap of faith and applied for a job in Sacramento,
            California (the closest he could be to LA at that time). As their love and commitment to each
            other continue to grow, Mark and Patricia have flown more than <i>80 flights</i> to defy distance;
            taking turns to visit each other and enjoy this literal and figurative journey of love and friendship together.
